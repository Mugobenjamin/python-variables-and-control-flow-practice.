Instructions for Python Practice Questions
1. GitHub Repository Setup
● Create a new repository on GitHub for this project.
● Name the repository something relevant, like
python-variables-and-control-flow-practice.
● Ensure your repository is public so that the instructor can review your code.
● Commit and push your solutions to this repository after completing each question.
2. Project Structure
● Each question should be written in a separate Python file. Name the files according
to the question, such as:
○ question1.py for Variable Assignment & Arithmetic Operations.
○ question2.py for Odd or Even Checker, and so on.
● Make sure your code is well-organized and readable, using comments where
necessary to explain key steps.
3. Content Review Before the Assessment
● Before starting the assessment, ensure you understand the following concepts. These
will help you solve the problems more easily:
○ Variables and Primitive Types: How to declare and use variables,
understanding integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
○ Control Flow Statements: Understanding how to use if, elif, and else
statements for decision-making.
4. Assessment Expectations
● Focus on clear, logical code and make sure to test your solutions with different inputs.
● The assessment is about applying your understanding of variables, primitive types, and
control flow statements in practical scenarios.
Questions
1. Variable Assignment & Arithmetic Operations
Write a program that assigns two numbers to variables a and b. Perform the following
operations and print the results:
● Addition
● Subtraction
● Multiplication
● Division
2. Odd or Even Checker
Write a Python program that asks the user for a number and then prints whether the number is
odd or even.
3. Grade Categorizer
Write a program that takes a score (0-100) as input and categorizes it into one of the following
grades:
● A (90-100)
● B (80-89)
● C (70-79)
● D (60-69)
● F (below 60)
4. Simple Calculator with Conditionals
Write a Python program that takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) from the user.
Perform the operation and print the result.
5. Simple Age Checker
Write a Python program that asks the user for their age and tells them whether they are a minor
(under 18), an adult (18-65), or a senior (over 65).
6. Password Validator
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "python123",
print "Access granted." Otherwise, print "Access denied."
7. Triangle Type Checker
Write a Python program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as input and
determines if the triangle is:
● Equilateral (all sides are equal),
● Isosceles (two sides are equal), or
● Scalene (all sides are different).
8. Day of the Week Checker
Write a Python program that asks the user to enter a number (1 to 7) and prints the
corresponding day of the week. If the number is outside the 1-7 range, print "Invalid input."
