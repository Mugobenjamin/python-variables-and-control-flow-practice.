# Variable Assignment & Arithmetic Operations
# Write a program that assigns two numbers to variables a and b.
# Perform the following operations and print the results:
# ● Addition
# ● Subtraction
# ● Multiplication
# ● Division

# Assign values to variables
a = 10
b = 5

# Perform arithmetic operations
addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b  # Make sure b is not zero to avoid division by zero error

# Print the results
print(f"Addition: {a} + {b} = {addition}")
print(f"Subtraction: {a} - {b} = {subtraction}")
print(f"Multiplication: {a} * {b} = {multiplication}")
print(f"Division: {a} / {b} = {division}")
